# It's Always Sunny In Philadelpha Digital Clock App

This app is meant to be run fullscreen on a tablet that is being used as 
a digital display. 

As a Philadelphia native who loves [It's Always Sunny in 
Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia), 
I built this app to rejuvenate my old Nexus 7 tablet. The app acts as 
a clock and is mimicing the time/place title card from the show:
